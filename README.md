# Radar Detection

This project was developed during an internship at **Research Centre Imarat (RCI), DRDO**, with the objective of simulating real-time radar detection and missile guidance systems. The project utilizes **CesiumJS** for 3D geospatial visualization and **Flask** for backend operations.

## Features

- **Radar Simulation**: Implements dynamic radar entities, simulating real-time detection signals.
- **Target Tracking**: Simulates moving targets with realistic paths and calculates their speeds.
- **Missile Launch**: Automatically launches missiles upon detecting targets within radar range.
- **Optimal Radar Placement**: Suggests radar locations based on terrain elevation data for enhanced detection efficiency.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time data display of radar activity and missile tracking through an intuitive UI.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: CesiumJS for 3D visualization
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Tools**: Cesium Ion for terrain data


## Usage

- **Radar Simulation**: Place radar entities at strategic locations and monitor their detection ranges.
- **Target Tracking**: Simulate and visualize multiple targets moving across the radar detection field.
- **Missile Guidance**: In the console we can see the missile has been launched on the detected points.
